The code itself looks good, there are some minor issues here and there, but there isn't anything that stands out to me as too glaring. This is a very good project for your first real personal project. Well done. 

Some organizational issues with the code. I don't understand why "basics" is a class if you aren't going to actually store anything in its values. Every function gets a dataset passed into it, and just outright returns the value. If that all that it has to do, you might as well just have everything be free functions.

If I were to design something like this, I would have the class take a dataset in its constructor, then calculate all the values in one single method call (say calculateStats). You can then find all the values by calling displayBlahBlah methods on the function. This will make sure you calculate everything once, and you don't have unnecessary copying and calculating going on in every single method call. You can still have sub-methods to calculate one thing or another, but those would be private and part of the implementation of calculateStats. 

All and all good start!
